# Ampeg B15N Double Baffle cabinet

This a 3D model of the [Ampeg B15N Double Baffle](https://www.talkbass.com/wiki/technical-speaker-cabinet/#2-double-baffle-cabinet) based on data gleaned from the web.

The lid has been simplfied to match the Ampeg PF-210HE's one:
- The lid gasket thickness is approx 5mm when the lid is in place with the latches
- [Southco Latch 97-50-220-15](https://southco.com/en_any_int/97-50-220-15)
- [Southco concealed keeper 97-67-103-15](https://southco.com/en_any_int/97-67-103-15)
  - which is not the one used by Ampeg but can't find the ref

It's build with [FreeCAD Link Daily](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD) version and uses metric system.

The 3D model is splitted in 2 files:
- The first file `B15N-Double-Baffle-Cabinet.parts.FCStd` contains all parts
  - They should be compatible with the standard FreeCAD version (0.20.1)
- The second file `B15N-Double-Baffle-Cabinet.asm3.FCStd` is the assembly based on the parts of the first file
  - It uses FreeCAD Assembly3 (FreeCAD Link Daily 20230131) and may be compatible with standard FreeCAD version (0.20.1)
